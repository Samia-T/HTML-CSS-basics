# HTML & CSS Basics

This repository showcases all the challenges and projects I completed while taking a foundational HTML & CSS course, **"Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)"** on Udemy by Brad Traversy.
It documents my progress as I learned the essential skills needed to build and style webpages from scratch.

## About This Repository

Throughout the course, I worked through a series of structured tasks—ranging from small concept-based challenges to full, functional mini-projects. This repo serves as a portfolio of everything I built while developing my front-end skills.
